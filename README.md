# The Can-sorting Robot

The cansort project is a repository for code used to control a can-sorting robot. The assembly code is specific to the PIC18F4620, the microcontroller chosen for this project. The PIC interfaces with the UTIAS-offered DevBugger microcontroller board (see the datasheet), which provides access to a variety of peripherals; these include a Real-Time Clock, HD44780 based LCD, 4x4 keypad/encoder module, and more.

This robot was constructed for a course called AER201, offered by the Division of Engineering Science at the University of Toronto. For more information, take a look at the project proposal or RFP.
